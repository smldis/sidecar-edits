# Sidecar Edits

Prototype tooling for building repeatable analog simulation runs from a base
directory and a small Python sidecar.

The renderer executes an edit file, copies the base tree, applies typed edit
operations, and writes one or more concrete run directories. The suggested edit
file name is `edits.py`, and the interface is plain Python while still providing
source-location error reports.

## Minimal Example

```python
from sidecar_edits import edits

BASE_DIR = "base"

EDITS = [
    edits.replace(
        path="input.scs",
        old="parameters corner=seed",
        new="parameters corner=tt",
    ),
]
```

## Quick Start

Install the package in editable mode:

```bash
python -m pip install -e .
```

Render the basic example:

```bash
sidecar-render examples/basic/edits.py /tmp/sidecar_example_run
```

Build the unit documentation when updating its source:

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[docs]"
python -m sphinx -b html docs docs/_build/html
```

## Main Sections

- [User Guide](user-guide.md): how to author an edit file, format parameters,
  inject generated sources, and read errors.
- [Examples](examples.md): runnable edit files included in the repository,
  including Excel-backed PWL source generation.
- [API Reference](api): generated signatures and docstrings for the edits API
  and PWL table helpers.
- [Design Notes](design/edits-api.md): implementation model and maintainer
  constraints for the edits API.

```{note}
This project is intentionally small and text-first. It favors explicit,
reviewable edits over a full simulator netlist model.
